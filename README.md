## üìñ Usage Guide

### Sending Notifications

```csharp
// Create a notification
var notification = new Notification
{
    Type = "UserJoined",
    Data = new { userId = "123", username = "John" },
    TargetGroups = new List<string> { "group1", "group2" }
};

// Send the notification
await _notificationService.SendNotificationAsync(notification);
```

### Receiving Notifications

```javascript
// Connect to the hub
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/notificationHub")
    .build();

// Handle incoming notifications
connection.on("ReceiveNotification", (notification) => {
    console.log("New notification:", notification);
});

// Connect with specific groups
await connection.start();
await connection.invoke("ConnectWithGroups", ["group1", "group2"]);
```

### Group Management

```csharp
// Subscribe to groups
await _groupService.SubscribeToGroupsAsync(userId, connectionId, groups);

// Unsubscribe from groups
await _groupService.UnsubscribeFromGroupsAsync(userId, connectionId, groups);
```

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NotifyHub.Domain/        # Domain models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-client/                 # Test client application
```

### Key Components

- **NotificationHub**: SignalR hub for real-time communication

- **EventHistoryService**: Handles notification history
- **NotificationService**: Core notification logic

## üîí Security

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Secure WebSocket connections

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Group-Based Notifications

NotifyHub now uses a flexible group-based notification system. Each event can be sent to specific groups, and users can subscribe to groups dynamically.

### Example Usage

1. Send a notification to specific groups:
```json
{
  "type": "task.created",
  "data": "{\"priority\": \"high\", \"message\": \"Important task!\"}",
  "targetGroups": ["admin", "developers"],
  "saveToHistory": true
}
```

2. Send a notification to all groups:
```json
{
  "type": "system.update",
  "data": "{\"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"message\": \"System updated\"}",
  "saveToHistory": true
}
```

## Event Filtering

The system supports filtering events based on their data. Filters can work with:

- JSON data
- Dictionary data
- Object properties

### Filter Examples

1. Filter by status:
```json
{
  "type": "order.created",
  "data": "{\"status\": \"completed\", \"orderId\": \"12345\"}"
}
```

2. Filter by numeric value:
```json
{
  "type": "payment.received",
  "data": "{\"amount\": 100.50, \"currency\": \"USD\"}"
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/token` - Get JWT token

### Events
- `POST /api/events` - Send a new event

## SignalR Hub

The application uses a SignalR hub for real-time communication:

- Hub URL: `/notificationHub`
- Client method: `ReceiveNotification`
- Authentication: JWT token required

## Security

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure WebSocket connections
- CORS configuration for development

## Development

## User Notification Configuration

Users can configure their notification preferences through the test client interface. The configuration includes:

- `FilterField`: Field to filter incoming notifications
- `FilterValue`: Value to match against the filter field
- `EventTypes`: Comma-separated list of event types to receive

### Example User Configuration

```json
{
  "filterField": "priority",
  "filterValue": "high",
  "eventTypes": ["task.created", "order.completed", "system.alert"]
}
```

This configuration will:
- Only show notifications where the `priority` field equals `high`
- Only receive notifications of type `task.created`, `order.completed`, or `system.alert`

## Testing the System

### Step 1: Connect to SignalR

1. Open `http://localhost:5500` in your browser
2. In the Authentication section:
   - Enter a User ID (e.g., "1")
   - Enter a Role (e.g., "admin")
   - Click "Get Token"
   - You should see "Token received" in the status
3. Click "Connect" to establish the SignalR connection
   - You should see "Connected" in the status

### Step 2: Configure User Notifications

1. In the Notification Configuration section:
   - Enter a Filter Field (e.g., "priority")
   - Enter a Filter Value (e.g., "high")
   - Enter Event Types (e.g., "task.created,order.completed")
   - Click "Save Configuration"
   - You should see a success message

### Step 3: Send Test Events

In the test client:

1. For group-specific notification with priority:
   - Event Type: `task.created`
   - Event Data: `{"priority": "high", "message": "Important task!"}`
   - Target Groups: `admin,developers`

2. For broadcast notification:
   - Event Type: `system.broadcast`
   - Event Data: `{"message": "System broadcast!"}`

The notifications will now include:
- Timestamp
- Event Type
- Username of the sender
- Event Data

## Troubleshooting

1. If you can't connect to SignalR:
   - Check that the API is running
   - Verify you have a valid token
   - Check the browser console for errors

2. If you don't receive notifications:
   - Verify you're connected to SignalR
   - Check that you've subscribed to the correct groups
   - Ensure the event type matches your configuration
   - Check the API logs for any errors

3. If you get CORS errors:
   - Make sure you're accessing the test client through `http://localhost:5500`
   - Verify the API is running on `https://localhost:5000`
